 This repository contains my solution for the IMARC Automation Engineer assessment. The project uses Python to scrape financial data, perform data analysis, and visualize results, demonstrating my skills in automation, data handling, and visualization.


The assessment involves the following steps:
1. **Install all the dependencies**: Given in the [requirements.txt](requirements.txt) file

2. **Importing the required dependencies and modules**: 
```python
